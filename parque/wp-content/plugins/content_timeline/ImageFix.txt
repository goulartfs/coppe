There are 2 usual issues regarding images:

1. Image popup doesn't show (when you click "change" button your screen darkens and nothing happens)
FIX: Open your theme "function.php" and at the beginning of the file (before <?php) insert paste this: <?php define('CONCATENATE_SCRIPTS',false); ?>

2. When you click "insert into post" images don't appear in the field
FIX: Open your FTP client and in folder "content_timeline/timthumb" set "cache" permissions to 711, and "timthumb.php" permissions to 701
